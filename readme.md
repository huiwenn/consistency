Here is the code for synthetic experiments! you shouldnâ€™t need anything else. The code for running the experiment is `bios_experiment.py`, where you might want to change boto3 credentials in the main function. If how to call LLMs has changed in the past few months, you can edit the code in `info.py`. 

it will probably take a LONG time, so run it in a background process or something. The code to analyze result is the `get_results_from_file` method in `bios_experiment.py`.

let me know if you are able to run it!
